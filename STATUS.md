# ExpertDB System Status

## Ready for Testing

The ExpertDB system has been prepared for its first test run with the following key components implemented:

1. **Authentication and User Management**:
   - JWT-based authentication system complete
   - Role-based access control (admin/user)
   - Protected API endpoints
   - Admin user auto-creation

2. **Logging System**:
   - Comprehensive structured logging
   - Request/response logging middleware
   - Configurable log levels and output
   - Error context and tracing

3. **Initialization Process**:
   - Automated setup script (run.sh)
   - Directory validation and creation
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Database initialization

4. **Database Operations**:
   - SQLite database with migrations
   - CSV data import functionality
   - Expert and user tables ready
   - ISCED classification mapping

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Standard error responses
   - HTTP status code mapping
   - Detailed error logging
   - Client-safe error messages

6. **Documentation**:
   - FIRST_RUN.md for setup instructions
   - IMPLEMENTATION.md for technical details
   - CLAUDE.md for project overview
   - STATUS.md for current status (this file)

## How to Test

To test the current implementation:

1. Run the initialization script:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

2. Test the API endpoints:
   - Login: `POST /api/auth/login`
   - List experts: `GET /api/experts`
   - View statistics: `GET /api/statistics` (authenticated)
   - Create user: `POST /api/users` (admin only)

3. Check the logs in the `./backend/logs` directory for system operation details.

## Known Limitations

1. Frontend integration not yet complete
2. Some API endpoints may require additional field validation
3. CSV import process requires specific format
4. Admin interface for user management not yet implemented in UI

## Next Development Phase

The next development phase will focus on:

1. Login page functionality and styling improvements (as first point of contact)
2. Frontend implementation for user management
3. Admin dashboard UI completion
4. Integration testing between frontend and backend
5. Document management UI implementation
6. Expert request workflow testing

## Deployment Readiness

The backend system is ready for initial testing but requires these additional steps for production deployment:

1. SSL configuration
2. Database backup procedures
3. Load testing and optimization
4. Security audit
5. Frontend completion with focus on login page as entry point
