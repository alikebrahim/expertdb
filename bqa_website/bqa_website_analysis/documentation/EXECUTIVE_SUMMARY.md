- **CSS**: Main theme styles, Bootstrap framework, and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Interactive functionality, animations, and performance optimizations

### 2. Visual Documentation
- **7 High-Quality Screenshots**: Capturing all UI components and interactive states
- **Component Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of each design element
- **Interaction Documentation**: Hover effects, dropdowns, and animations

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
- **Master Replication Guide**: Complete implementation roadmap
- **Technical Analysis**: CSS architecture, JavaScript functionality, responsive design
- **Design System**: Color palette, typography, component library
- **File Inventory**: Complete list of all extracted materials

## Technical Specifications

### Design System
