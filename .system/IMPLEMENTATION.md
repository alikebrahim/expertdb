## Integration Points

### Current Integration Issues
- ⚠️ Login API working but UI needs improvement
- ⚠️ Expert fetching works but display/filtering needs work
- ❌ Document upload not integrated
- ❌ Expert requests not integrated
- ❌ Statistics not integrated

### Authentication Integration
- **API**: POST `/api/auth/login` (working)
- **Frontend**: Login form submits to API (working)
- **Issue**: Form styling and error handling incomplete

### Expert Search Integration
- **API**: GET `/api/experts` with query parameters (working)
- **Frontend**: Basic search implemented (partial)
- **Issue**: Advanced filtering UI incomplete

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Current Phase)
1. Complete login page styling using shadcn/ui components
2. Add loading spinner during authentication
3. Implement proper error handling with styled messages
4. Add form validation with error states
5. Test and validate authentication persistence

### Secondary Priorities (Next Phase)
1. Complete expert search with advanced filtering
2. Implement expert profile page
3. Create expert request form and workflow
4. Build statistics dashboard with visualizations
5. Complete user management admin UI

### Tertiary Priorities
1. Implement document upload/management
2. Develop expert engagement tracking
3. Create reporting and export features
4. Add system settings and configuration
5. Prepare deployment documentation

## Technical Debt and Issues

1. **Auth Persistence**: Recent fixes for token persistence need validation
2. **Form Validation**: Inconsistent form validation across the application
3. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling and display
4. **Loading States**: No consistent loading indicators
5. **Component Reuse**: Duplicate code that should be refactored into reusable components
