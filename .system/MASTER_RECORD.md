# Master Record

This document serves as a chronological record of actions and changes made to the ExpertDB project. It provides a timeline of development activities to maintain context and track progress.

## 2025-03-12

### Project Setup
- Created `.system/` directory to house structured context files
- Updated main `CLAUDE.md` file with new persona and guidelines
- Generated initial structured context files:
  - ENDPOINTS.md - API mapping for frontend-backend integration
  - UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md - Component standards and current status
  - FUNCTION_SIGNATURES.md - Key function reference
  - AUTH_GUIDELINES.md - Authentication flow and role-based logic
  - IMPLEMENTATION.md - Progress tracking and next steps
  - MASTER_RECORD.md - This action log
  - ISSUE_LOG.md - Bug tracking and resolution

### Initial Analysis
- Reviewed ExpertDB codebase structure and implementation
- Identified authentication flow issues requiring resolution
- Mapped API endpoints and their current frontend integration status
- Documented UI component status, focusing on login page needs
- Identified key function signatures for tracing code paths
- Assessed current implementation progress at approximately 60-70%

### Current Focus
- Login page styling and functionality is the immediate priority
- Authentication persistence fixes need validation
- Expert search functionality needs completion
- Expert request workflow requires implementation
- Statistics dashboard is a secondary priority

### Repository Cleanup
- Removed placeholder directories (backend/ai-placeholder, backend/frontend-placeholder)
- Removed duplicate and outdated ENDPOINTS.md and IMPLEMENTATION.md files outside .system/
- Removed scattered issue documentation files (BE_ISSUE.md, git_issue.md, phase2_issue.md)
- Fixed code issues:
  - Removed "Dear Claude" comments from backend/types.go
  - Fixed variable naming consistency in backend/api.go
  - Removed references to non-existent endpoints in AuthContext.tsx
  - Removed unnecessary ESLint disable comments
- Consolidated frontend directories:
  - Removed old /frontend directory
  - Renamed frontend_new to frontend
  - Preserved .vite directory during migration
  - Updated package.json name to "expertdb-frontend"
- Updated docker-compose.yml to reflect new AI service structure

## Next Actions
- Enhance login page UI with shadcn/ui components
- Add loading states during authentication
- Improve error handling in login form
- Test authentication persistence across sessions
- Work on expert search filtering implementation
