# Issues for Consideration

This document tracks implementation issues and configuration decisions that need to be addressed during the ExpertDB development process.

## 1. Email Notification System
**Context:** All notifications will be sent via email (no in-app notifications)
**Required for:**
- Expert request status updates (approved/rejected/amendment needed)
- Assignment notifications for planners and managers
- Expert rating request notifications
- Automatic reminders for pending ratings

**Considerations:**
- Email service provider selection (SMTP, SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
- Email templates for different notification types
- Email queue management for reliability
- Unsubscribe/preference management
- Email delivery tracking and bounce handling

## 2. Starting Phase Number Configuration
**Context:** Phases represent academic semesters and are numbered sequentially (Phase 22, Phase 23, etc.)
**Issue:** The system will continue from existing phases that won't be imported, requiring a configurable starting number (likely Phase 23 or 24)

**Considerations:**
- Where to store the base phase number (config file, environment variable, database setting)
- How to ensure phase numbers are sequential and unique
- Migration strategy if the starting number needs to change

## 3. Automatic Reminder System
**Context:** Rating requests have a 2-week deadline and automatic reminders should be sent
**Requirements:**
- Send initial rating request notification
- Send reminder notifications (frequency to be determined)
- Track reminder status to avoid duplicate sends

**Considerations:**
- Reminder schedule (e.g., 7 days before deadline, 3 days, 1 day)
- Background job scheduling system
- Handling weekends and holidays
- Manager notification preferences
- Escalation path for overdue ratings

## 4. Honorarium PDF Generation
**Context:** Account managers need to generate honorarium reports for applications
**Requirements:**
- Create a facility for account managers to generate honorarium.pdf for applications
- Button interface to generate reports including panel details
- Calculate remuneration based on provided schedule

**Considerations:**
- PDF generation library selection
- Remuneration schedule configuration and storage
- Report template design and branding
- Panel member data aggregation
- Payment calculation logic based on roles and time commitments
- File generation and download handling

## 5. Documents and Database Backup Mechanism
**Context:** System needs automated backup capabilities for documents and database with super_user configuration
**Requirements:**
- Automated backup mechanism for SQLite database and document files
- API endpoints for super_user to configure backup schedules
- Interface for super_user to view backup files and status
- Integration with system settings in the admin panel for backup configuration
- Configurable backup retention policies

**Considerations:**
- Backup storage location (local, cloud storage integration)
- Backup frequency configuration (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Compression and encryption of backup files
- Database consistency during backup operations
- Document file synchronization with database backups
- Backup verification and integrity checks
- API design for backup configuration and monitoring
- Backup restoration procedures and testing

## 6. Expert Request Endpoint Duplication and Naming Confusion
**Context:** The system currently has two separate endpoints for updating expert requests with overlapping functionality and inconsistent access control patterns.

**Current Implementation:**
- `PUT /api/expert-requests/{id}` - Handled by `HandleUpdateExpertRequest`
- `PUT /api/expert-requests/{id}/edit` - Handled by `HandleEditExpertRequest`

**Functional Differences:**
1. **HandleUpdateExpertRequest** (PUT /api/expert-requests/{id}):
   - Primary purpose: Status management (approve/reject requests)
   - Can handle status changes: approved, rejected, pending
   - When status = "approved": Creates expert profile via `ApproveExpertRequestWithDocument()`
   - Complex approval logic with document requirements
   - Access control: Admin can edit any request, users can edit only their own rejected requests

2. **HandleEditExpertRequest** (PUT /api/expert-requests/{id}/edit):
   - Primary purpose: Data editing (modify request fields)
   - Cannot change status, focuses on updating request data
   - Simple data update without approval logic
   - Auto-resets status: If user edits rejected request â†’ status becomes "pending"
   - Access control: Admin can edit pending requests, users can edit rejected requests

**Issues Identified:**
- Overlapping responsibilities: Both can update request data
- Inconsistent access control rules between endpoints
- Non-standard REST naming with `/edit` suffix
- Confusing separation of concerns (status vs data updates)
- Potential for data inconsistency with different update paths

**Considerations:**
- **Consolidation Option**: Merge into single `PUT /api/expert-requests/{id}` endpoint
- **Access Control Standardization**: Unified permission model across both functions
- **Clear Separation**: If keeping separate, clarify distinct responsibilities
- **API Consistency**: Follow standard RESTful patterns
- **Breaking Changes**: Impact on existing clients/documentation
- **Testing Requirements**: Ensure all functionality is preserved during consolidation

**Recommended Approach:**
Consolidate into single endpoint that handles both data updates and status changes based on request payload, with unified access control logic.

## 7. Outstanding TODO Items Requiring Resolution

**Context:** During code review, several TODO comments were identified that require implementation decisions or completion.

### 7.1 Transaction Rollback in Expert Request Creation
**Location:** `internal/api/handlers/expert_request.go:183`
**TODO Comment:** `// TODO: Consider rolling back the request creation here`

**Issue:** Expert request creation follows a two-step process:
1. Create expert request record in database
2. Upload CV document and link to request

If step 2 fails, step 1 remains committed, leaving an expert request without a CV in the database.

**Current Behavior:** Request remains in database with failed CV upload, potentially causing data inconsistency.

**Considerations:**
- **Option A**: Implement rollback by deleting the request if CV upload fails
- **Option B**: Use database transactions to ensure atomicity across both operations
- **Option C**: Accept current behavior as valid (requests can exist temporarily without CVs)
- **Option D**: Implement CV upload first, then create request with document reference

**Risk Level:** Medium - Affects data consistency and user experience

### 7.2 Rating Storage Implementation
**Location:** `internal/api/handlers/phase/phase_handler.go:806`
**TODO Comment:** `// TODO: Store rating in application_ratings table (when implemented)`

**Issue:** Expert rating functionality mentions storing ratings in `application_ratings` table but implementation status is unclear.

**Investigation Required:**
- Verify if `application_ratings` table exists in current database schema
- Check if ratings are being stored through alternative mechanism
- Determine if this represents missing functionality or outdated comment

**Current Behavior:** Rating submission appears to work but storage mechanism needs verification.

**Considerations:**
- Database schema review and potential migration needs
- Rating data model and relationships
- Historical rating data preservation
- Rating retrieval and reporting functionality

**Risk Level:** High - Critical for rating system functionality

### 7.3 Expert Names and Rating Status Retrieval
**Location:** `internal/api/handlers/phase/phase_handler.go:871`
**TODO Comment:** `// TODO: Get expert names and rating request status from database`

**Issue:** Manager tasks functionality currently returns incomplete information, missing expert names and rating request status.

**Current Behavior:** Returns basic task information without full expert details or rating status.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Enhance database queries to join expert information
- Include expert names in response payload
- Add rating request status tracking
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API consumers

**Considerations:**
- Database query performance with additional joins
- API response format changes and versioning
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed expert information
- Impact on mobile/frontend applications

**Risk Level:** Medium - Affects user experience and functionality completeness

### 7.4 Advanced Filtering Implementation
**Location:** `internal/api/handlers/phase/phase_handler.go:951`
**TODO Comment:** `// TODO: Implement more sophisticated filtering in storage layer`

**Issue:** Current filtering implementation is basic and could be enhanced with more advanced capabilities.

**Current Behavior:** Basic filtering functionality that may not meet all user requirements.

**Enhancement Opportunities:**
- Multi-criteria filtering with AND/OR logic
- Date range filtering for time-based queries
- Text search across multiple fields
- Sorting by multiple columns
- Pagination improvements

**Considerations:**
- Performance impact of complex queries
- Database indexing strategy
- API complexity vs. usability trade-offs
- Frontend filtering UI requirements
- Backward compatibility with existing filter parameters

**Risk Level:** Low - Enhancement rather than critical functionality
