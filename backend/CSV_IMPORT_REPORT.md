# CSV Import Implementation Report

## Changes Made

1. **Simplified Storage Implementation**:
   - Removed the in-memory database implementation from storage.go
   - Eliminated automatic schema initialization in the NewSQLiteStore function
   - Database migrations are now handled exclusively via the goose command line tool

2. **CSV Import Tool**:
   - Updated the CSV import tool in cmd/import_csv to verify if the database schema exists before importing data
   - Modified the default database path to match the expected path used in the application
   - Added better error reporting and user guidance when schema doesn't exist

3. **Server Verification**:
   - Added a verifyDatabaseSchema function to server.go that checks if required tables exist
   - Server now terminates with a clear error message if database schema is incomplete
   - In-memory databases for testing bypass this check since they're initialized differently

4. **Documentation**:
   - Updated the README with detailed instructions on how to use the CSV import tool
   - Added prerequisites and steps for using goose to apply migrations
   - Provided column information for the expected CSV format

## Recommendations for CSV Import

Based on the implementation changes, here are the recommendations for managing CSV imports:

1. **Database Migration Workflow**:
   - Run goose migrations first: `goose -dir db/migrations/sqlite sqlite3 ./db/sqlite/expertdb.sqlite up`
   - This creates all necessary tables and indexes
   - Then run the CSV import tool: `./import_csv -csv path/to/data.csv`

2. **CSV Import Strategy**:
   - Keep the CSV import as a separate command-line tool rather than integrating it into the migration process
   - This provides flexibility to import data at any time, not just during initial setup
   - The tool can be extended to support updates/refreshes of existing data

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The import tool now fails gracefully with clear error messages if migrations haven't been applied
   - Server startup verifies schema existence to prevent operation with incomplete database structure

4. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - For production deployment, consider creating a setup script that:
     1. Runs goose migrations
     2. Imports initial data if needed
     3. Starts the server
   - Document this process clearly in deployment guides

5. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Consider adding a dry-run option to the CSV import tool to validate data without making changes
   - Add support for updating existing records based on unique identifiers
   - Implement data validation to prevent importing malformed or inconsistent data

## How to Run CSV Import

The process for importing CSV data is now:

1. **Prepare the Database**:
   ```
   mkdir -p db/sqlite
   goose -dir db/migrations/sqlite sqlite3 ./db/sqlite/expertdb.sqlite up
   ```

2. **Build the Import Tool**:
   ```
   go build -o import_csv ./cmd/import_csv
   ```

3. **Run the Import**:
   ```
   ./import_csv -csv path/to/experts.csv -db ./db/sqlite/expertdb.sqlite
   ```

The tool will verify that the necessary tables exist before attempting to import data, providing clear error messages if prerequisites are not met.
