# Phase 1 (Authentication) Fixes

## Fix Log

### 1. Issue: Authentication Redirect Logic (2025-03-06)

**Problem**:  
When hitting the root route (`/`), the app redirected to `/search` even when no active session existed, instead of redirecting to `/login` as expected. This occurred because the app was only checking for the token's existence in localStorage without validating if it was associated with a valid user object.

**Expected Behavior**:  
- Redirect to `/login` if unauthenticated
- Redirect to `/search` if authenticated as regular user
- Redirect to `/admin` if authenticated as admin

**Root Cause**:  
The authentication check in the router was only verifying the presence of a token in localStorage, without validating if the token was valid or if there was an associated user object.

**Files Modified**:
1. `/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Added proper authentication validation
2. `/src/App.tsx` - Updated redirect logic
3. `/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Improved route protection

**Changes Made**:
1. Added `isAuthenticated` property to `AuthContext` that checks both token and user
2. Added token validation on app mount to verify stored tokens
3. Updated `App.tsx` to use `isAuthenticated` instead of just token for root route redirection
4. Updated `ProtectedRoute` to use `isAuthenticated` instead of token check

**Implementation Details**:
- Added token validation via `/api/auth/me` endpoint on application load
- Implemented proper token cleanup for invalid tokens
- Created a more robust authentication check that requires both token and user object

**Testing Notes**:
The fix can be verified by:
1. Logging in and verifying proper redirection (admin to `/admin`, regular user to `/search`)
2. Logging out and verifying redirection to `/login`
3. Manually clearing user data but keeping token in localStorage, then verifying the app redirects to `/login`
