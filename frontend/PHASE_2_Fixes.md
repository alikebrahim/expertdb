# Phase 2 (Expert Database Search) Fixes

## Fix Log

### 1. Issue: React 19 Compatibility with shadcn/ui (2025-03-06)

**Problem**:  
shadcn/ui components failed to install due to compatibility issues with React 19. The installation process stalled during dependency installation even after configuring proper import alias settings.

**Expected Behavior**:  
- shadcn/ui components should install and function correctly
- The Search page should render with shadcn/ui components

**Root Cause**:  
React 19 has breaking changes that caused compatibility issues with shadcn/ui and its dependencies. The shadcn CLI detected React 19 and warned about possible peer dependency issues but the installation process stalled.

**Files Modified**:
1. `/tsconfig.json` - Updated with proper import alias configuration
2. `/package.json` - Updated React version from 19 to 18.3.1
3. Multiple shadcn component files installed

**Changes Made**:
1. Downgraded from React 19 to React 18.3.1
2. Updated TypeScript React types to match React 18
3. Set up proper import alias configuration in tsconfig.json
4. Successfully installed shadcn/ui components
5. Created Search.tsx implementing the expert search functionality
6. Updated App.tsx to use the new Search component

**Implementation Details**:
- Used shadcn/ui components (Input, Select, Table, Button) for the Search UI
- Implemented filters for name, affiliation, ISCED field, Bahraini status, and availability
- Added client-side sorting functionality for expert names
- Added pagination support with Previous/Next buttons
- Handled loading and error states appropriately

**Testing Notes**:
The fix can be verified by:
1. Running `npm run dev` and navigating to `/search` (after login)
2. Checking that shadcn/ui components render correctly
3. Testing filters and pagination functionality
4. Verifying that experts data loads correctly (may need to mock API responses)

### 2. Issue: ESLint Unused Variable Errors (2025-03-06)

**Problem**:  
ESLint errors for unused catch clause variables were occurring in multiple files.

**Expected Behavior**:  
- Code should pass linting without errors

**Root Cause**:  
The ESLint configuration didn't recognize the convention of prefixing unused variables with underscore (_err).

**Files Modified**:
1. `/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Modified catch clause
2. `/src/pages/Search.tsx` - Modified catch clause
3. `/eslint.config.js` - Attempted to add ignored pattern rule

**Changes Made**:
1. Removed the error variable entirely from catch clauses
2. Used empty catch blocks instead of named catch parameters

**Implementation Details**:
Changed from:
```typescript
catch (_err) {
  // error handling
}
```
To:
```typescript
catch {
  // error handling
}
```

**Testing Notes**:
The fix can be verified by running `npm run lint` and confirming there are no errors (only warnings for shadcn components).

### 3. Issue: Redirect from `/search` to `/login` After Login (2025-03-06)

**Problem**:  
After logging in and being redirected to the appropriate page, navigating to `/search` would redirect back to `/login` as if the session was lost.

**Expected Behavior**:  
- User should remain logged in after navigation
- Authenticated users should be able to access the search page without being redirected
- Authentication state should persist across page refreshes

**Root Cause**:  
`AuthContext`'s `isAuthenticated` property required both `token` and `user` to be present, but only the `token` was being persisted in localStorage. The `user` object wasn't being stored, causing the authentication check to fail after page refresh.

**Files Modified**:
1. `/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated to persist user data in localStorage
2. `/src/pages/Login.tsx` - Updated to use shadcn/ui components for consistency
3. `/eslint.config.js` - Updated to ignore shadcn/ui components 
4. `/TESTING.md` - Updated mock authentication instructions

**Changes Made**:
1. Modified `AuthContext.tsx` to:
   - Store and retrieve `user` object from localStorage
   - Update authentication validation to check both token and user
   - Improve error handling for `/api/auth/me` endpoint when backend isn't running
2. Updated `Login.tsx` to use shadcn/ui components (Input, Button) for consistency
3. Added `src/components/ui/*` to ESLint ignore patterns to prevent warnings
4. Updated testing documentation with clearer mock auth examples

**Implementation Details**:
- Added localStorage logic to persist and retrieve user data
- Modified authentication state initialization to check for stored user data
- Implemented graceful fallback when backend validation isn't available
- Updated login flow to store both token and user object

**Testing Notes**:
The fix can be verified by:
1. Logging in to the application
2. Navigating to different pages (e.g., `/search`, `/admin`)
3. Refreshing the page and confirming authentication is maintained
4. Testing with mock data in localStorage when backend isn't available
