# Phase 2 (Expert Database Search) Fixes

## Fix Log

### 1. Issue: React 19 Compatibility with shadcn/ui (2025-03-06)

**Problem**:  
shadcn/ui components failed to install due to compatibility issues with React 19. The installation process stalled during dependency installation even after configuring proper import alias settings.

**Expected Behavior**:  
- shadcn/ui components should install and function correctly
- The Search page should render with shadcn/ui components

**Root Cause**:  
React 19 has breaking changes that caused compatibility issues with shadcn/ui and its dependencies. The shadcn CLI detected React 19 and warned about possible peer dependency issues but the installation process stalled.

**Files Modified**:
1. `/tsconfig.json` - Updated with proper import alias configuration
2. `/package.json` - Updated React version from 19 to 18.3.1
3. Multiple shadcn component files installed

**Changes Made**:
1. Downgraded from React 19 to React 18.3.1
2. Updated TypeScript React types to match React 18
3. Set up proper import alias configuration in tsconfig.json
4. Successfully installed shadcn/ui components
5. Created Search.tsx implementing the expert search functionality
6. Updated App.tsx to use the new Search component

**Implementation Details**:
- Used shadcn/ui components (Input, Select, Table, Button) for the Search UI
- Implemented filters for name, affiliation, ISCED field, Bahraini status, and availability
- Added client-side sorting functionality for expert names
- Added pagination support with Previous/Next buttons
- Handled loading and error states appropriately

**Testing Notes**:
The fix can be verified by:
1. Running `npm run dev` and navigating to `/search` (after login)
2. Checking that shadcn/ui components render correctly
3. Testing filters and pagination functionality
4. Verifying that experts data loads correctly (may need to mock API responses)

### 2. Issue: ESLint Unused Variable Errors (2025-03-06)

**Problem**:  
ESLint errors for unused catch clause variables were occurring in multiple files.

**Expected Behavior**:  
- Code should pass linting without errors

**Root Cause**:  
The ESLint configuration didn't recognize the convention of prefixing unused variables with underscore (_err).

**Files Modified**:
1. `/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Modified catch clause
2. `/src/pages/Search.tsx` - Modified catch clause
3. `/eslint.config.js` - Attempted to add ignored pattern rule

**Changes Made**:
1. Removed the error variable entirely from catch clauses
2. Used empty catch blocks instead of named catch parameters

**Implementation Details**:
Changed from:
```typescript
catch (_err) {
  // error handling
}
```
To:
```typescript
catch {
  // error handling
}
```

**Testing Notes**:
The fix can be verified by running `npm run lint` and confirming there are no errors (only warnings for shadcn components).
