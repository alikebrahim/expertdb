## Testing Instructions

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`
4. The application will be available at: `http://localhost:5173/`

### Testing Authentication (Phase 1)
1. Visit the login page at `/login`
2. Enter credentials:
   - Email: [test credentials to be provided]
   - Password: [test credentials to be provided]
3. Upon successful login:
   - Admin users should be redirected to `/admin`
   - Regular users should be redirected to `/search`
4. Test role-based access:
   - Try accessing `/admin` as a regular user (should redirect to `/search`)
   - Try accessing any protected route while logged out (should redirect to `/login`)

### Mock Authentication for Development
If the backend server is not running, you can simulate authentication:
1. Open your browser console on the login page
2. Execute: `localStorage.setItem("token", "mock-token")`
3. Refresh the page - you should be redirected to `/search`

## Known Issues
- shadcn/ui components not implemented due to import alias configuration issues
- Backend API integration is prepared but not tested with actual backend
