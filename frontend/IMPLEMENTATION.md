- PDF generation

### Phase 4: Statistics Dashboard ⏳
- Charts and data visualization
- Data aggregation from backend

### Phase 5: Admin Panel ⏳
- User management
- Request approval workflow
- Expert profile management

### Phase 6: Polish and Deployment Prep ⏳
- UI refinements
- Performance optimizations
- Final testing

## Testing Instructions

### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`
4. The application will be available at: `http://localhost:5173/`

### Testing Authentication (Phase 1)
1. Visit the login page at `/login`
2. Enter credentials:
   - Email: [test credentials to be provided]
   - Password: [test credentials to be provided]
3. Upon successful login:
   - Admin users should be redirected to `/admin`
   - Regular users should be redirected to `/search`
4. Test role-based access:
   - Try accessing `/admin` as a regular user (should redirect to `/search`)
   - Try accessing any protected route while logged out (should redirect to `/login`)

### Mock Authentication for Development
If the backend server is not running, you can simulate authentication:
1. Open your browser console on the login page
2. Execute: `localStorage.setItem("token", "mock-token")`
3. Refresh the page - you should be redirected to `/search`

### Testing Expert Search (Phase 2)
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to the search page at `/search`
3. Test the search functionality:
   - Enter a name in the search field
   - Select an ISCED field from the dropdown
   - Filter by affiliation, Bahraini status, and availability
4. Test the sorting functionality by clicking on the "Name" column header
5. Test pagination by clicking the "Next" and "Previous" buttons
6. Test error handling by temporarily disconnecting from the backend

## Known Issues
- Backend API integration is prepared but not tested with actual backend
- ISCED field names not displayed in the table (only IDs are shown)
