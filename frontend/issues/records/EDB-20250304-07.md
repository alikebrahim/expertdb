# Issue: UI/UX Improvements and Bug Fixes

## Reference Code: EDB-20250304-07

## Category: UI/UX

## Status: FIXED

## Date Identified: March 4, 2025

## Description

Multiple UI/UX issues have been identified in the current implementation that need to be addressed:

1. No dedicated landing page implementation - the application should redirect to /search when logged in, or /login when not logged in
2. Button styling issues where white text becomes invisible on white background when hovering
3. SVG logo usage is unclear - proper guidelines needed for navbar vs footer implementation
4. Need for clear site structure and process flow diagrams in documentation

## Technical Details

### Issue 1: Root Page Redirection
- Current implementation already redirects properly but needs to be verified and documented
- Navigation structure needs to be made clearer in UI/UX guidelines

### Issue 2: Button Styling Bug
- White text on white background during hover state
- Needs proper contrast implementation according to BQA color guidelines
- Affects login button and possibly other UI elements

### Issue 3: Logo Usage
- Need to properly define which logo variant should be used in navbar vs footer
- Current options:
  - BQA - Horizontal Logo.svg
  - BQA - Horizontal Logo with Descriptor.svg
  - BQA - Vertical Logo - With descriptor.svg
  - Icon Logo - Color.svg

### Issue 4: Documentation Diagrams
- Missing site structure and process flow diagrams
- Need to implement mermaid.js diagrams in UI/UX guidelines

## Steps to Reproduce

1. For button issue: Visit the login page and hover over buttons
2. For logo issue: Check current implementation in navbar.tsx and footer.tsx
3. For missing diagrams: Review UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md

## Severity

Medium - Visual issues and documentation improvements that don't completely break functionality but impact user experience

## Priority

High - These are core design and navigation issues that need immediate attention

## Resolution

1. **Root Page Redirection Logic**
   - Verified that the current implementation in `app/page.tsx` properly redirects to /search if authenticated and /login if not
   - Documented the routing structure in the UI/UX guidelines with a mermaid diagram

2. **Button Styling Issues**
   - Fixed button styling by adding a new `outlineInverse` button variant in `components/ui/button.tsx`
   - Updated the login/logout buttons in the navbar to use this new variant
   - Added explicit hover text color to ensure white text stays visible on hover

3. **SVG Logo Usage Guidelines**
   - Analyzed the available logo variants and documented proper usage in UI/UX guidelines
   - Specified which logo to use in navbar (Horizontal Logo) vs login page (Horizontal Logo with Descriptor) vs footer (Icon Logo)
   - Added size and spacing recommendations

4. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Added comprehensive site structure diagram using mermaid.js
   - Created process flow diagrams for expert request submission and search functionality
   - Enhanced the UI/UX guidelines document with clear usage instructions

## Files Modified

1. `/frontend/UI_UX_GUIDELINES.md` - Added site structure, process flows, and logo usage guidelines
2. `/frontend/components/ui/button.tsx` - Added outlineInverse variant 
3. `/frontend/components/layout/navbar.tsx` - Updated login/logout buttons to use new variant
