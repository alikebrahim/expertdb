### Key Technical Solutions

1. **Loading States**:
   ```tsx
   {isLoading ? (
     <div className="space-y-4">
       {/* Skeleton loading for results */}
       <div className="flex justify-between items-center mb-4">
         <div className="h-7 w-32 bg-muted animate-pulse rounded"></div>
         <div className="flex gap-2">
           <div className="h-9 w-20 bg-muted animate-pulse rounded"></div>
           <div className="h-9 w-32 bg-muted animate-pulse rounded"></div>
         </div>
       </div>
       
       {Array.from({ length: 3 }).map((_, i) => (
         <Card key={i} className="overflow-hidden">
           <CardContent className="pt-6">
             {/* Skeleton content */}
           </CardContent>
         </Card>
       ))}
     </div>
   ) : (
     // Normal content
   )}
   ```

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   ```tsx
   try {
     // API request
   } catch (error: any) {
     // Enhanced error handling
     if (error.response) {
       // Server responded with an error status
       const errorMessage = error.response.data?.error || `Server error: ${error.response.status}`;
       setError(errorMessage);
       console.error('API error response:', errorMessage, error.response);
     } else if (error.request) {
       // Request was made but got no response
       setError('Unable to connect to the server. Please check your internet connection and try again.');
       console.error('API request error (no response):', error.request);
     } else {
       // Something else caused the error
       setError('An unexpected error occurred. Please try again.');
       console.error('API unexpected error:', error.message);
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Responsive Improvements**:
   ```tsx
   <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-6">
     {/* Search filters - sticky on desktop */}
     <Card className="lg:col-span-1 h-fit sticky top-4">
       {/* Filter content */}
     </Card>
     
     {/* Results column */}
     <div className="lg:col-span-3">
       {/* Results content */}
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
