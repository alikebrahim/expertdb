let me provide you some information that i want you to incorporate in the UI_UX_GUIDLINES:
- There's no landing page, per se. I want the web app to display the /search for db search if the user has a loged in session else he should be redirected to /login when visiting root/
- The current design has some flows. for instance the button shows while and upon hover would turn blue. since the text is in white, I can't seen the 'login' text on the button. It just shows as a while block
- describe the svg logos and decide which is most appropriate to be used in the navbar and which one is best to be used on the footer
- create a mermaid.js snippet in the UI_UX_GUIDLINES.md document that describes: 1. Site structure 2. Process diagram (e.g. submit expert)
Note the following issues and create a bug report (tracking).

Important remarks:
- ISSUES.md should link 
  - Screenshots: {frontend,backend}/issues/screenshot: is where referenced screenshots are to be found
  - Records: {frontend,backend}/issues/records: where records are to be saved
  - When I instruct claude to check issue with {frontend,backend}. Claude will search the relevant issue.md file, will analyse the notes, create a templated file according to a reasonable schema for tracking relevant information in the Records dir (e.g. ISSUECODE-IDENTIFIER.md). issue.md will not be tampered with! ensure this point
  - ensure revisiting the ISSUES.md system, putting into consideration the mentioned points


  Begin with important remarks, then analyse the ui/ux issue accordingly.
