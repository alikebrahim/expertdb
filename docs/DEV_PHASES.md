# Project Development Finalization Phases

## Phase 1: Expert Database
### Backend Implementation Status: Completed
- API endpoints for expert CRUD operations are fully implemented with validation messages
- Expert request workflows are implemented with complete linking to expert creation
- Specialization area management is implemented and fully functional
- Document management for expert CVs and approval documents is implemented
- Expert filtering system is implemented with support for multiple filter criteria
- Expert request batch approval functionality is implemented

### Frontend Requirements
- **All Users**: Complete the expert search and filtering interface in SearchPage
- **Users/Planners**: Implement expert request submission flow
- **Admin**: Create interface for request review and approval/rejection
- **Admin**: Finalize specialization area management UI

## Phase 2: Phase Planning
### Backend Implementation Status: Completed
- Core phase and application APIs are fully implemented
- Assignment workflows for planners to phases are implemented
- Expert assignment to applications with validation is functional
- Approval/rejection workflows for phase assignments exist
- Permission handling for different user roles is implemented
- Integration between phases and engagements is functional
  - QP applications create validator engagements
  - IL applications create evaluator engagements
- Single expert assignment support (no batch operations yet)
- Basic validation for expert suitability implemented

### Frontend Requirements
- **Admin**: Develop phase creation interface with application items
- **Admin**: Implement planner assignment to applications
- **Planner**: Create interface for selecting experts per application
- **Admin**: Build review/approval interface for planner suggestions

## Phase 1 & 2 Finalization
### Backend Implementation Status: Partially Completed
- Email notification system backend is not implemented
- Integration between phases (expert creation → phase planning → engagements) is now complete
- Comprehensive end-to-end workflow testing is partially established
- Cross-cutting permission controls have been implemented for all endpoints
- Database indexes for optimizing common queries have been added
- Basic data validation is implemented across all endpoints

### Requirements
- **System**: Implement email notification system backend
- **All Roles**: Integrate notification triggers into frontend workflows
- **System**: Extend testing of complex edge-case workflows

## Phase 3: Statistics
### Backend Implementation Status: Completed
- All statistics endpoints are implemented with comprehensive system overview
- Expert growth, nationality, and area statistics are fully functional
- Engagement statistics include proper aggregation by type and status
- Statistical calculations use efficient database queries
- Basic filtering for statistical reports is implemented
- Yearly growth statistics are implemented (replaced monthly statistics)
- Performance optimized for current dataset size (<2000 experts)

### Frontend Requirements
- **All Users**: Complete implementation of StatsPage (with role-appropriate access)
- **All Users**: Implement visualization components for statistical data
- **Admin**: Create filtering options for custom reports

## Phase 4: Expert Review
### Backend Implementation Status: Partially Started
- Basic rating fields exist in the data model (`feedback_score` in engagements, `rating` in experts)
- Query parameters for sorting by rating are implemented
- Existing expert update endpoints support rating updates
- Rating values are standardized to a specific format
- No dedicated rating workflow API endpoints
- No approval process for submitted ratings
- No calculation of aggregate ratings across multiple engagements
- Rating validation logic is basic
- Partial integration with expert profile and engagement system exists

### Frontend Requirements
- **Users/Planners**: Implement interface to rate experts based on engagements
- **Admin**: Create review interface for submitted ratings
- **Admin**: Build approval/rejection workflow for expert ratings
- **Admin**: Develop notification system to request ratings from users/planners
