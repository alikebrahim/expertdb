# ExpertDB System Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This System Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the ExpertDB tool, an internal web application for managing a database of experts. The tool supports a small department (10-12 users) with a modest database (up to 2000 expert entries over 5 years). The SRS guides development by clarifying existing functionality, addressing gaps, and specifying new features based on stakeholder requirements and known implementation issues.

### 1.2 Scope

ExpertDB is a lightweight tool for managing expert profiles, requests, engagements, documents, phase planning, and statistics. It supports:

- User management with roles: `super_user`, `admin`, `user` with contextual elevations.
- Expert profile creation, management, and requests with mandatory approval documents.
- Document uploads (CVs, approval documents).
- Engagement tracking and phase planning for Qualification Placement (QP) and Institutional Listing (IL) applications.
- Statistics (annual growth, nationality representation, engagement counts by QP/IL).
- Specialization area management.
- Data import and CSV backup.

The tool uses Go, SQLite, and JWT authentication, emphasizing simplicity, internal use, and minimal dependencies. Security is handled organizationally, and high load is not expected.

### 1.3 Definitions

- **Super User**: A privileged user created during initialization, responsible for creating admin users.
- **Admin**: A user with full access to manage users, experts, requests, engagements, areas, and phase planning.
- **User**: A user who can submit expert requests, view expert data/documents, and view phases. Can be elevated to planner/manager for specific applications.
- **Planner Elevation**: Contextual privilege allowing a user to propose experts for specific applications within phases.
- **Manager Elevation**: Contextual privilege allowing a user to provide expert ratings for specific applications when requested by admin.
- **Expert**: A professional with a profile (e.g., name, institution, skills) in the database.
- **Expert Request**: A user-submitted proposal to add a new expert, pending admin review (statuses: `pending`, `rejected`, `approved`).
- **Engagement**: An expertâ€™s assignment to a task (validator or evaluator) tied to QP or IL applications.
- **Specialization Area**: A category for classifying experts (e.g., Business, Engineering).
- **Phase Plan**: A planning period with applications (QP or IL) requiring expert assignments.
- **Application**: A task within a phase plan, either Qualification Placement (QP) or Institutional Listing (IL).

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 User Needs

- **Super Users** need to:
  - Create admin users during system setup.
- **Admins** need to:
  - Manage users, experts, and specialization areas.
  - Review, edit, approve/reject expert requests with mandatory approval documents, including batch approvals.
  - Create phase plans, assign applications to planners, and approve/reject planner-proposed experts.
  - View statistics (annual growth, nationality, engagements by QP/IL).
  - Generate CSV backups.
- **Users (Regular)** need to:
  - Submit expert requests with CVs.
  - Browse and filter expert profiles/documents.
- **Planner Users** need to:
  - Submit expert requests with CVs.
  - Propose experts (Expert-1, Expert-2) for phase plan applications.
  - Browse and filter expert profiles/documents.
- The system must support data import, CSV backups, and detailed statistics.

### 2.2 Assumptions and Constraints

- **Assumptions**:
  - The tool is internal, with organizational security measures.
  - SQLite is sufficient for the database size and load.
  - Accepted CV and approval documents are in PDF format.
  - Phase plan applications are predefined by admins as QP or IL.
  - Dependencies are minimal: `golang-jwt`, `google/uuid`, `mattn/go-sqlite3`, `golang.org/x/crypto`.
- **Constraints**:
  - Maximum 10-12 concurrent users.
  - Database growth capped at 2000 expert entries over 5 years.
  - No internet exposure; no advanced security features needed.
  - Minimal new dependencies to maintain simplicity.

- **Current Implementation**: JWT implemented with role checks (`auth/middleware.go`, `jwt.go`).
- **Requirement**: No changes needed.
- **Priority**: Medium (organizational security).

## 5. Future Considerations

- **API Development**: Status-filtered requests (FR3.2) and area statistics (FR7.5) support client applications. Ensure JSON-friendly API responses.
- **Phase Planning**: Validate cascade deletion for planner assignments (FR1.3).
- **Data Import/Backup API**: Enhance `py_import.py` as an API endpoint.
- **Testing**: Update `test_api.sh` to cover new endpoints (phase planning, engagement import, area statistics) and workflows.

## 6. Assumptions

- Users have basic API training.
- CSV imports and backups occur infrequently.
- Honorarium documents are pre-cleaned (CSV/JSON).
- Approval documents are validated as type `approval_document`, with flexibility for formats (e.g., PDF, DOC).
