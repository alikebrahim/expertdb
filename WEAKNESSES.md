Weaknesses & Areas for Improvement:

Critical Bug - Handling NULL Database Values: The ListExperts function (in list_experts.go) fails because it doesn't correctly scan nullable database columns (like specialized_area, biography, cv_path, phone, updated_at, expert_id, is_available) into the Expert struct.
Impact: Prevents listing experts, a core function.
Fix: Modify the Scan calls in ListExperts (and likely GetExpert in expert_operations.go) to use appropriate sql.Null* types (e.g., sql.NullString, sql.NullBool, sql.NullTime) and check the .Valid field after scanning before assigning to the struct fields.
Critical Bug - Unique Constraint Violation: Creating experts fails with UNIQUE constraint failed: experts.expert_id (expert_storage.go).
Impact: Prevents adding new experts directly or via request approval.
Analysis: The backend attempts to generate and check unique IDs (GenerateUniqueExpertID, ExpertIDExists) before inserting, but this process is failing. This could be a flaw in the generation/checking logic, a race condition (less likely with SQLite defaults), conflicting pre-existing data, or an issue in how IDs are handled differently between direct creation and request approval.
Fix: Requires debugging the ID generation, checking, and insertion logic within CreateExpert and potentially handleUpdateExpertRequest. Ensure the ExpertIDExists check is reliable within the transaction context if applicable.
Inconsistent/Generic Error Handling: While makeHTTPHandleFunc provides some top-level error mapping (401, 403, 404), many internal errors (database errors, validation errors within handlers) result in generic 500 Internal Server Error responses. fmt.Errorf is used, but often without wrapping (%w) the original error, losing context.
Improvement: Implement more specific error types or check underlying errors within handlers to return more informative HTTP status codes (e.g., 409 Conflict for unique constraint errors, 400 Bad Request for specific validation failures) and clearer error messages in the JSON response. Consistently use error wrapping.
Complex Dynamic SQL Scanning: The approach in expert_request_operations.go to dynamically fetch column names using PRAGMA table_info and scan into []interface{} is significantly more complex and potentially less performant/safe than explicitly listing columns in the SELECT statement and scanning directly into struct fields (using sql.Null* types where needed). While it aims for flexibility against schema changes, it makes the code harder to read, maintain, and debug. Consider refactoring to use standard explicit scanning unless there's a compelling reason for the dynamic approach.
Payload Handling in handleCreateExpert: The multi-step process (decode to map -> modify map -> marshal -> unmarshal to struct) seems overly complex just to handle potential type conversion for generalArea. A cleaner approach might be to unmarshal directly into the CreateExpertRequest struct and perform type validation/conversion within the Go code if necessary.
Input Validation: While ValidateCreateExpertRequest exists, validation could be more comprehensive across other handlers (e.g., checking ID formats, string lengths, enum values, date ranges).
Potential Payload Mismatch (CreateExpertRequest vs Expert): The CreateExpertRequest uses fields like affiliation, availability, skills, while the target Expert struct uses institution, isAvailable. The NewExpert function bridges this, but it adds complexity. Ensuring the API documentation and frontend usage align with CreateExpertRequest is important.
