# CSV Import Issues Report

## Overview
Analysis of the expert data import process identified several data quality and formatting issues that require attention. This document categorizes all issues found during the import of 441 expert records.

## 1. CSV Structure/Formatting Issues (CRITICAL)

### Malformed Rows with Column Misalignment
**Impact:** 6 records have incorrect data mapping due to CSV parsing errors

| Row | Expert Name | Issue Description | Root Cause |
|-----|-------------|------------------|------------|
| 42 | Aisha Akbari | Column data shifted, None keys detected | Quoted field with internal commas: "Human Resources, Leadership, Business Administration" |
| 47 | Ali Alsoufi | Column data shifted, None keys detected | Institution field: "Independent ICT Consultant, and P.T. Academic Lecturer and Freelancer" |
| 299 | Sana Ayoob | Column data shifted, None keys detected | Similar quoted field formatting issue |
| 414 | Yousif Alharam | Column data shifted, None keys detected | Institution field with commas and quotes |
| 416 | Mohamed Al-Sayed | Column data shifted, None keys detected | Institution field formatting issue |
| 431 | Mr. Mohammed Alsendi | Column data shifted, None keys detected | Institution field formatting issue |

**Recommended Action:** 
- [ ] Fix CSV escaping by properly handling commas within quoted fields
- [ ] Validate CSV structure before import
- [ ] Consider using alternative delimiter or better escaping

## 2. General Area Mapping Issues (MEDIUM)

### Unmapped Area Categories
**Impact:** Experts incorrectly categorized under default "Business" area

| Original Area | Current Mapping | Suggested Mapping | Affected Records |
|---------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| "Academic" | Business (ID: 1) | Education (ID: 12) | Multiple records |
| "Employer" | Business (ID: 1) | Context-dependent | Multiple records |

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Create mapping rule: "Academic" → "Education" 
- [ ] Review "Employer" entries individually for proper categorization
- [ ] Add fallback mapping logic for ambiguous terms

## 3. Data Normalization Differences (LOW)

### Minor Content Variations
**Impact:** Small inconsistencies between original and normalized data

| Field | Original | Normalized | Impact |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|
| Institution | "Bahrain Teaching Institute - BTI" | "Bahrain Training Institute - BTI" | Cosmetic |
| General Area | "Business - Banking &  Finance" | "Business - Banking & Finance" | Extra space removed |
| Specialized Area | "Chemisty" | "Chemistry" | Spelling correction |

**Recommended Actions:**
- [ ] Accept normalization changes (improve data quality)
- [ ] Document normalization rules for future imports

## 4. Import Processing Results

### Success Metrics
- ✅ **Total Records Processed:** 441/441 (100%)
- ✅ **Fatal Errors:** 0
- ✅ **Database Integrity:** Maintained
- ✅ **Specialized Areas:** Correctly parsed and created

### Warning Summary
- ⚠️ **Malformed Rows:** 6 (1.4%)
- ⚠️ **Default Mappings Used:** ~8 records
- ⚠️ **Minor Data Corrections:** ~3 records

## 5. Decision Matrix

### Priority 1: MUST FIX
- [ ] **CSV Structure Issues** - Fix malformed rows with column misalignment
  - **Risk:** Data integrity compromised for affected experts
  - **Effort:** Medium (manual CSV editing)

### Priority 2: SHOULD FIX  
- [ ] **General Area Mappings** - Add proper mappings for "Academic" and "Employer"
  - **Risk:** Incorrect categorization affects search/filtering
  - **Effort:** Low (code update)

### Priority 3: COULD FIX
- [ ] **Data Normalization** - Accept minor improvements in normalized version
  - **Risk:** Minimal impact
  - **Effort:** Low (use normalized CSV)

## 6. Recommended Action Plan

### Immediate Actions (Before Production)
1. **Fix Critical CSV Issues**
   - Manually correct the 6 malformed rows
   - Ensure proper CSV escaping for comma-containing fields
   - Re-run import validation

2. **Improve Area Mappings**
   - Update `py_import.py` fallback mapping dictionary
   - Add: `'academic': 12` (Education)
   - Review "Employer" entries case-by-case

### Optional Improvements
3. **Use Normalized Data**
   - Consider using `experts_normalized.csv` as source
   - Validate that corrections are acceptable

4. **Enhanced Validation**
   - Add pre-import CSV structure validation
   - Implement area mapping reports for review

## 7. Files Affected
- `experts_original.csv` - Source data with issues
- `experts_normalized.csv` - Corrected version with minor improvements  
- `py_import.py` - Import script requiring mapping updates
- Database - Currently contains data with default mappings for problematic areas

**Next Steps:** Review this report and decide on priority actions before proceeding with production data import.
