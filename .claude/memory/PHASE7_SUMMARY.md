# Phase 7: Expert Engagement Integration - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation details for Phase 7 of the API integration plan, focusing on Expert Engagement Integration.

## Overview

Phase 7 involved implementing a comprehensive engagement management system that allows administrators to create, view, edit, and delete expert engagements. The implementation includes API integration, UI components, and integration with the expert profile system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. API Integration

Added the following engagement-related API methods in `api.ts`:

- `getEngagements` - Retrieve a paginated list of all engagements
- `getEngagementById` - Retrieve a specific engagement by ID
- `createEngagement` - Create a new engagement
- `updateEngagement` - Update an existing engagement
- `deleteEngagement` - Delete an engagement
- `getExpertEngagements` - Retrieve all engagements for a specific expert

### 2. Data Models

Created the `Engagement` interface in `types/index.ts` with the following structure:

```typescript
export interface Engagement {
  id: number;
  expertId: number;
  requestId: number | null;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  engagementType: string;
  status: string;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  contactPerson: string;
  contactEmail: string;
  organizationName: string;
  notes: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}
```

### 3. Components Created

1. **EngagementForm**
   - Form for creating and editing engagements
   - Supports related expert request selection
   - Includes validation and error handling
   - Handles both create and update operations

2. **EngagementList**
   - Displays engagements for a specific expert
   - Includes pagination
   - Provides view, edit, and delete functionality
   - Integrated into expert detail page

3. **EngagementManagementPage**
   - Comprehensive page for managing all engagements
   - Includes filtering by status, type, and search terms
   - Expert selection for new engagements
   - Full CRUD operations

### 4. Integration with Existing Components

1. **ExpertDetailPage**
   - Added EngagementList component to show engagements for the expert
   - Improved layout to accommodate new section

2. **App.tsx**
   - Added route for the engagement management page
   - Protected route with admin role requirement

3. **Sidebar**
   - Added link to the engagement management page in the sidebar menu
   - Restricted to admin users

### 5. Features Implemented

1. **Engagement Creation**
   - Form with validation
   - Ability to link with expert requests
   - Date range selection

2. **Engagement Listing**
   - Tabular view with key information
   - Status indicators with color coding
   - Pagination support

3. **Engagement Management**
   - View engagement details
   - Edit existing engagements
   - Delete engagements with confirmation
   - Filter and search engagements

4. **Expert Engagement Integration**
   - View engagements for a specific expert
   - Add engagements directly from expert profile

## Testing Performed

- Verified API integration for all engagement operations
- Tested pagination and filtering functionality
- Validated form submission and error handling
- Confirmed proper integration with expert profiles
- Checked role-based access controls
- Ran ESLint to ensure code quality

## Notes & Considerations

- The engagement system is designed to be flexible, allowing both standalone engagements and those linked to expert requests
- The status workflow allows tracking of engagement progress from pending to completed
- The UI provides visual cues for engagement status with color-coded badges
- All engagement operations maintain audit trails with timestamps

## Next Steps

With Phase 7 complete, the next phase will be:

- Phase 8: Testing and Refinement

## Conclusion

The implementation of Phase 7 adds comprehensive engagement management capabilities to the ExpertDB system. Administrators can now track all expert engagements, and expert profiles now display their engagement history.
