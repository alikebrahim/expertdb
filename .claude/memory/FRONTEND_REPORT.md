# Frontend Implementation Status Report

## Overview

The ExpertDB frontend is a React-based web application built with TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a user interface for managing experts, expert requests, and user accounts, with role-based access control.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui
- **Form Handling**: react-hook-form
- **Routing**: react-router-dom 7.3
- **HTTP Client**: axios 1.8
- **Data Visualization**: recharts 2.15

## Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT-based Authentication**: The frontend stores JWT tokens in localStorage
- **Role-based Access Control**: Two user roles - `admin` and `user`
- **Protected Routes**: Routes require authentication, with some routes restricted to admin role
- **Login Persistence**: Authentication state persists across page reloads
- **Automatic Redirection**: Unauthenticated users are redirected to login page

## Features

### User Authentication
- ✅ Login form with validation
- ✅ Automatic role-based redirection after login
- ✅ Protected routes with access control
- ✅ Session persistence across reloads

### Expert Search
- ✅ Searchable and filterable expert listing
- ✅ Expert details view in modal dialog
- ✅ Filter by name, role, type, affiliation, and availability

### Expert Request Management
- ✅ Expert request form with validation
- ✅ File upload for CVs and documents
- ✅ Request status tracking (pending, approved, rejected)

### Admin Panel
- ✅ User management (view, create, edit users)
- ✅ Expert request approval workflow
- ✅ Role-based access control

### Statistics and Analytics
- ✅ Expert nationality distribution chart
- ✅ Expert growth over time chart
- ✅ ISCED field distribution chart

### UI Components
- ✅ Custom form inputs with validation
- ✅ Responsive tables with sorting
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Modal dialogs
- ✅ Layout components (header, footer, sidebar)

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: The application uses a React Context API (`AuthContext`) to manage authentication state
2. **API Integration**: API requests are centralized in the `services/api.ts` file using axios
3. **Data Fetching**: Components fetch data directly from API services using async/await
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages

## Code Organization

The codebase follows a well-structured organization:

- **`/components`**: Reusable UI components
- **`/pages`**: Page-level components 
- **`/services`**: API integration and services
- **`/contexts`**: React contexts for state management
- **`/hooks`**: Custom React hooks
- **`/types`**: TypeScript type definitions

## Issues and Limitations

1. **Token Security**: JWT tokens are stored in localStorage, which is vulnerable to XSS attacks
2. **Error Handling**: Some API responses could use more consistent error handling
3. **Form Validation**: Some form validations could be enhanced with stronger validation rules
4. **Testing**: No evidence of unit or integration tests

## Recommendations

1. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Switch from localStorage to HttpOnly cookies for token storage
   - Implement token refresh mechanism
   - Add CSRF protection

2. **UX Improvements**:
   - Add pagination for large data tables
   - Improve form validation with more detailed error messages
   - Add success notifications for completed actions

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Implement unit and integration tests
   - Add more documentation for complex components
   - Formalize error handling patterns across components

4. **Performance**:
   - Implement data caching for frequently accessed resources
   - Add lazy loading for larger components
   - Optimize bundle size with code splitting
