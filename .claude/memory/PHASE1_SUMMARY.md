# Phase 1 Implementation Summary: Core Authentication and URL Standardization

This document details the implementation of Phase 1 from the [API integration plan](INTEG_PLAN.md). It focuses on standardizing API URL patterns and improving error handling.

## Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Endpoint URL Fix
- Updated auth login endpoint from `/auth/login` to `/api/auth/login` to match API documentation
- Improved debug logging to only show sensitive data (like login credentials) when debug mode is enabled

### 2. URL Standardization
- Removed redundant `/api` prefixes from all endpoint URLs since they're already included in the baseURL
- Updated all service endpoints:
  - Experts: `/api/experts` → `/experts`
  - Expert Requests: `/api/expert-requests` → `/expert-requests`
  - Users: `/api/users` → `/users`
  - Statistics: `/api/statistics/*` → `/statistics/*`

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- Enhanced error handling with more specific error messages based on HTTP status codes
- Added better user-friendly messages for common errors:
  - 400: "Invalid request data"
  - 403: "Permission denied"
  - 404: "Resource not found"
  - 500: "Server error occurred"
- Added specific handling for network timeouts and connection errors
- Implemented conditional logging based on debug mode to prevent sensitive information leakage in production
- Restructured error handling logic for better clarity and maintainability

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All API endpoints now follow a consistent URL pattern
2. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages provide better user feedback
3. **Security**: Reduced sensitive data logging in production environments
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code structure makes future updates easier

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

The next phase will focus on data structure alignment:
- Update frontend interfaces to match API response structures
- Fix data type mismatches
- Ensure proper handling of API responses across components
